    - summary: "🤩 GITHUB STATS 🤩"
      text: >
        A number of visitors have requested to see the GitHub stars listed for each GitHub entry in Awesome Claude Code.
        On the one hand, I agree this is useful information - on the other hand, I don't want to give a bad impression especially for
        repos that are very newly published, that serve a smaller niche, or whose star count does not reflect their awesomeness.
        So, what I decided to do was create a disclosure panel with a number of GitHub stats
        (thank you to [anuraghazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra), maintainer of [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats), for making this easier!),
        including number of open issues, age of repo, and, yes, star count, so that (a) the information is available, but hidden by default,
        and (b) there is more context than just the star count alone (thanks to [hesreallyhim](https://github.com/hesreallyhim) for adding the latter functionality in a recent [fork](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/github-readme-stats-plus)).
        This way, if you see a repo with no stars but which is only 2 days old, you have more context.
        Feel free to open an issue or discussion if you think this feature has negative value, or if you have suggestions for improvement.
    - summary: "DONATIONS"
      text: >
        I am sad to say that I did not receive many donations this week, despite my call-to-action - however, I think the donation flow was a little cumbersome, and I am hoping to have an easier link available soon.
        That being said... I am extremely happy to announce that thanks to the generosity of some generous donors, **WE DID MANAGE TO RAISE OVER $100 FOR THE BAIL PROJECT IN THE PAST WEEK!!!** 🎉🎉 
        Thank you so much to those individuals - for now I will not publicize the list of donors, so that people may feel more comfortable once we have a large enough total amount raised
        that the amount of their particular contribution will not be identifiable. Please do consider contributing any amount at all - 
        but for now, I will wait until I have received a proper fundraising link to share before making another call to action.
        This really means a lot to me, and I will do my best to make sure that those contributions are reflected in time dedicated to maintaining this repository.
        (FWIW, despite the large number of open Issues, I did make a number of reviews as well this week, even though not every issue I reviewed has been merged in yet.)
        THANK YOU FOLKS! 🙏🙏🙏

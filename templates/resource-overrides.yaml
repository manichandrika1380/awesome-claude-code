# Resource Overrides Configuration
# This file allows manual overrides of specific resource fields
# Use resource IDs to target specific resources
# Set field_locked: true to prevent validation scripts from changing the value

# Example override structure:
# overrides:
#   cmd-a3f2b9c4:  # Resource ID
#     license: "LicenseRef-MIT-Commons-Clause"  # Override value
#     license_locked: true  # Lock this field from validation updates
#     notes: "Has Commons Clause restriction"  # Optional notes
#   cmd-xyz123:  # Resource ID
#     skip_validation: true  # Skip this resource entirely during validation
#     notes: "Temporarily unavailable for validation"

overrides:
  # Example: Override license for Claude Task Manager (inactive resource)
  wf-d0cfdd2b: # Claude Task Manager
    license: "LicenseRef-MIT-Commons-Clause" # Override value
    license_locked: true # Lock this field from validation updates
    notes: "Has Commons Clause restriction" # Optional notes
  tool-984936a7:
    skip_validation: true # Skip this resource entirely during validation
    notes: "Temporarily unavailable for validation" # Claude Code Chat
  status-4e8a47cf:
    license: "MIT"
    license_locked: true
# Supported override fields:
# - license: Override the detected license
# - license_locked: Prevent license validation from updating
# - active: Override the active status
# - active_locked: Lock the active status
# - description: Override the description
# - description_locked: Lock the description
# - last_checked: Override last checked timestamp
# - last_checked_locked: Lock the timestamp field
# - skip_validation: Skip entire resource during validation (true/false)
#
# Notes:
# - Use resource IDs (e.g., cmd-a3f2b9c4) not display names
# - Locked fields will be skipped during validation
# - Resources with skip_validation: true are completely skipped by validation scripts
# - Overrides take precedence over CSV data during generation

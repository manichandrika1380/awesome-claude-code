## Donations üí∞ [üîù](#awesome-claude-code)

I like drinking coffee, but I _really_ like bail relief.

If you want to support this repository, you can do so by making a donation in my name to [The Bail Project](https://bailproject.org/), which helps pay for people's cash bail, so that people who are presumed innocent don't have to sit in a cage waiting for a court appearance. Although that doesn't directly compensate any of my work here, it would motivate me to continue to devote my time, energy, and resources, and any reader or project that donates will receive recognition (including one of these badass badges). Please check out the [DONATING](/DONATING.md) page for detailed information.

### A note about licenses [üîù](#awesome-claude-code)

Because simply listing a hyperlink does not qualify as redistribution, the license of the original source is not relevant to its inclusion. However, for posterity and convenience, we do host copies of all resources whose license permits it. Therefore, please include information about the resource's license. Additionally, take note: _if you do not include a LICENSE in your GitHub repo, then by default it is fully copyrighted and redistribution is not allowed_. So, if you are intending to make an open source project, it's critical to pick from one of the many available open source licenses. This is just a reminder that without a LICENSE, your project is not open source (it's merely source-code-available) - it may of course still be included on this list, but this notice is to inform readers about the default rules regarding GitHub and LICENSE files. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) for more details.
